A collection of interactive nodes that provide convenient workflow tools for ComfyUI.

## NOTE:
```
I'm not sure if this is a normal way to do things, but rather than validation I simply use seed to trigger running the node again with the same inputs if I require.
Most of the time you will want to set these to Fixed for the node to run once and not again unless the inputs change.
But if you need them to proc again, just change the seed value and it will run again with the same inputs.
```

## 🎯 NODES SO FAR:

**Z-Image - Images To LoRA**: Brings DiffSynth-Studio's Z-Image i2L pipeline into ComfyUI as a convenient single-node solution for converting image batches to LoRA models.

**Image Selector**: Interactive image selection from folders with thumbnail grid view, sorting, folder navigation, and asynchronous loading for enormous folders.

**Crop Image Batch to Mask Bounds**: Intelligent cropping of image batches based on mask boundaries with consistent output dimensions.

**Interactive Pose Editor**: Pose manipulation with multi-person support, hierarchical editing, undo/redo, and caching.

## 🔧 OTHER UTILS

### Z-Image - Images To LoRA (ae)

**Category:** `ae-in-workflow`

Convert image batches to LoRA models using DiffSynth-Studio's pipeline, with direct integration for ComfyUI workflows.

Convert images to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) using the Z-Image pipeline from DiffSynth-Studio. This node processes batches of images and generates LoRA files that can be used with LoraLoaderModelOnly nodes.

**Powered by:** [DiffSynth-Studio](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio)

#### Key Features:

### Crop Image Batch to Mask Bounds (ae)

**Category:** `ae-in-workflow`

**✂️ Intelligent Mask-Based Cropping**: Crop image batches to mask boundaries with options for individual or combined cropping, ensuring consistent output dimensions.

This node crops images based on mask boundaries, with two modes for different use cases. Perfect for preparing masked objects or scenes for further processing while maintaining alignment between images and masks.

#### Key Features:

- **🔄 Two Cropping Modes**: Individual object cropping or combined scene cropping
- **📐 Consistent Dimensions**: All outputs have matching dimensions with intelligent scaling and padding
- **🎨 Custom Padding**: Choose padding color for consistent backgrounds
- **🔄 Mask Alignment**: Output masks are cropped/resized identically to maintain perfect alignment

#### Modes:
- **mask_for_each**: Crop each image to its individual mask bounds, scale UP to match combined bounds (maintaining aspect ratio), pad as needed
- **sum_of_masks**: Crop all images to the combined bounds of all masks (scene-level cropping)

#### Inputs:
- **images** (required): Batch of images to crop (B,H,W,C)
- **masks** (required): Corresponding masks defining crop boundaries (B,H,W)
- **invert_mask** (optional): Invert masks before finding bounds (default: False)

- **optional_new_width** (optional): Pad images to this width before processing (default: 0)
- **optional_new_height** (optional): Pad images to this height before processing (default: 0)

#### Outputs:
- **images**: Cropped and resized images with consistent dimensions
- **masks**: Corresponding masks cropped, resized, and padded to match images

#### Usage Notes:
- **Empty Masks**: Images with empty/invalid masks are cropped to full bounds
- **Aspect Ratio**: Cropped content maintains original proportions with padding
- **Batch Consistency**: All images in batch end up with identical dimensions
- **Mask Alignment**: Output masks perfectly align with their corresponding images

### Interactive Pose Editor (ae)

**Category:** `ae-in-workflow`

**🎭 Interactive Pose Editor**: Pose manipulation with multi-person support, hierarchical editing, undo/redo, and caching.

An interactive pose editor that allows users to manipulate OpenPose keypoints with full control.

## Usage Examples

### ✂️ Mask-Based Image Cropping
1. **Generate Masks**: Use segmentation models to create masks for objects/scenes
2. **Connect Inputs**: Feed image batch and corresponding mask batch to Crop node
3. **Choose Mode**:
   - Use "mask_for_each" for individual objects (each cropped to its own bounds, then resized to match)
   - Use "sum_of_masks" for scenes (all cropped to combined bounds)
4. **Adjust Settings**: Set padding color and optional padding as needed
5. **Consistent Output**: All images now have identical dimensions, ready for batch processing

### 🎯 Image Selection: Curate Your Dataset
1. **Set Folder Path**: Point to a folder containing your images
2. **Launch Selector**: Click queue to open the interactive browser
3. **Browse & Select**: Scroll through thumbnails, click images to select/deselect
4. **Finish Selection**: Press ESC or ENTER when done
5. **Auto Processing**: Images are automatically resized and batched
6. **Connect to Next**: Feed the batched images directly to other nodes

**Pro Tip**: Set target dimensions if you need consistent sizes, otherwise it auto-sizes based on your largest selected image.

### 🎭 Basic Pose Editing
1. Load pose data from OpenPose detection or ControlNet
2. Connect to the Pose Editor node
3. Click "Queue" to launch the interactive editor
4. Edit poses using mouse and keyboard controls
5. Close the editor to get the modified pose data

### 👥 Multi-Person Scene Creation

2. Use Ctrl+N to add more T-pose people
3. Position and edit each person individually
4. Use Ctrl+D to duplicate poses for variations
5. Export the complete multi-person scene

### 🎬 Animation Chains & Iterative Refinement
1. Edit a pose and save it
2. Next time you load the same pose data, it starts with your previous edits
3. Use Ctrl+Z to reset to the original if needed
4. Link multiple Pose Editor nodes for frame-by-frame animation
5. Chain Z-Image nodes with different image batches for style variations
